# dotfiles

These are the configurations and packages that I use for my setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisities

The supported distros for automatic installation of packages:
    - Ubuntu 19/18/16/14. (18/16/14 is not tested)
    - Arch. (not supported, yet)
    If you feel that I need to support other distros, feel free to make an issue.

```git``` is optional.

To download the files, using git:

```
git clone https://github.com/realaltffour/dotfiles.git
```

or you can download the files directly from Github.

### Installing

If you want to install the packages and configuration files:

```
./deploy.sh
```

If you want to install the configuration files only:

```
./load_store.sh
```

If you want to generate the files from you current configuration:

```
./generate_store.sh
```
